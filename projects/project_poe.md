<p>
  The goal of the project was to explore the benefits of powering LED fixtures using power over ethernet (PoE) when compared to traditional AC power. In a traditional lighting system, the high voltage AC lines need to be placed in electrical conduit specified by the US National Electrical Code. However since ethernet cables are used to pass DC with much lower voltage, the regulation for ethernet cables are much more lenient. The ethernet cables can be run through walls and ceilings without the need for conduits and special licence to install them. As a result, the installation cost is reduced and the installation is much more flexible. In addition to power, the PoE system delvers data similar to standard ethernet protocols.

  Since a single cable can carry data and power, it also adds the benefit of fine control of divces that are being powered
