<p>
Shape Shifter is an Android game built with Unity3D in C#. The game was one of my personal projects during the summer of 2016. The project started off with brainstorming and creating as many game concepts on a piece of paper. After thinking of many ideas, the most interesting games were put into Unity as a prototype. The most entertaining prototype was a game where the player morphs into a triangle, square, pentagon, or a hexagon to match the edges which flies towards the player. This game is now known as <i>Shape Shifter</i>. The purpose of this summer project was to experience the whole process of developing a game to publishing it to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Azuligno.ShapeShifter" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>.

<h2>Brainstorming</h2>

<p>
  The project started off by brainstorming ideas on to a piece of paper and sketching out many concepts as possible. Some of the game concepts that made it to the prototyping stage are:

</p>  

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Color Balance</b> - Connect colorful circles together to try to stop them from growing. The circles will continue to grow unless it is connected to another circle with an opposite color. For example, if a red circle and a green circle is connected together, the two colors will cancel each other and start to shrink. The game ends when the colorful circles fill up the screen and the score is calculated by the amount of time the player was able to survive. The prototype did not feel fun to play and finding the right circle with opposite colors were confusing for the players.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Monkey Climb</b> - Navigate the cheerful monkey up the tree that seems to be growing infinitely into the sky. Use your fingers to control the monkey by swiping your fingers up on the screen. The direction, and speed will determine how the monkey will jump. The prototype was more difficult than you think since the player can not control the monkey once it leaves the branch.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Shape Shifter</b> - Morph your shape into a triangle, square, pentagon, or a hexagon to dodge the incoming edges flying towards the shape.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The Monkey Climb and Shape Shifter prototypes were the most fun to play out of all of the prototypes that I had built. After contemplating on which prototype to continue working to make it into a full game, I decided to go with Shape Shifter. Although the Monkey Climb prototype was fun to play, there were too many obstacles at that time (such as creating higher quality art assets and problems with the platform spawning algorithm) for me to finish before the summer ends.

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>
  The development of Shape Shifter was simple since most of the game mechanics were already implemented in the prototype.
