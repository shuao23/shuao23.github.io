<p>
Shape Shifter is an Android game built with Unity3D in C#. The game was one of my personal projects during the summer of 2016. The project started off with brainstorming and creating as many game concepts on a piece of paper. After thinking of many ideas, the most interesting games were put into Unity as a prototype. The most entertaining prototype was a game where the player morphs into a triangle, square, pentagon, or a hexagon to match the edges which flies towards the player. This game is now known as <i>Shape Shifter</i>. The purpose of this summer project was to experience the whole process of developing a game to publishing it to the Google Playstore.

<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
<p>
The project started off by brainstorming ideas on to a piece of paper and sketching out many concepts as possible. The shape shifting idea came from a kids toy where you have to match the shapes with the holes in the box.
