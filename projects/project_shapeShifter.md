  Shape Shifter is an Android game built with Unity3D in C#. The game was one of my personal projects during the summer of 2016. The project started off with brainstorming and creating as many game concepts on a piece of paper. After thinking of many ideas, the most interesting games were put into Unity as a prototype. The most entertaining prototype was a game where the player morphs into a triangle, square, pentagon, or a hexagon, to match the edges which flies towards the player. This game is now known as <i>Shape Shifter</i>. The purpose of this summer project was to experience the whole process of developing a game to publishing it to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Azuligno.ShapeShifter" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>.
