<p>
  The goal for this project was to write a console debugger program in assembly language and to run it on a m68000 emulator. The debugger program consisted of many subroutine functions to help analyze the current state of the processor. The help command can be seen in the screenshot above. The debugger program consisted of commands such as sorting and displaying memory contents. In addition, the debugger can run user programs by passing in the program start address as the parameter. I was able to challenge my assembly coding skill and learn how the m68000 works. In addition to the project, the course consisted of labs where I physically wired components such as the asynchronous communications interface adapter (ACIA)  to the processor.
